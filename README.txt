|The Project was developed for a coding challenge for the Carnegie Robotics LLC. The Alg-|
|orithm used is mainly based on the research paper, Adaptive Thresholding using the Inte-|
|gral Image [1].									 |
|											 |
|The package consists of a file named algorithm.py where the adaptive thresholding algor-|
|ithm is developed. Run it and it should produce the results. Also, you can play around  | 
|the threshold value and the sample_window size to achieve different results. For faster |
|computation, the images were resized to 256x196. 					 |
|											 |
|Note: The second input & output doesn't show until the first input & output are closed. |

|Dependencies: numpy, opencv								 |
|											 |
|1. numpy is used to perform matrix operations.						 |
|2. opencv is used to read the image, resize the image, display and write the image.	 |
|											 |
|Developed using Anaconda, spyder, python3.						 |
